F-Droid Client
==============

Client for [F-Droid](https://fdroid.org), the Free Software repository system
for Android.


Building from source
--------------------

The only required tools are the Android SDK and Apache Ant.

```
git submodule update --init
./ant-prepare.sh # This runs 'android update' on the libs and the main project
ant clean release
```

The project itself supports Gradle, but some of the libraries it uses don't.
Hence it is currently not possible to build F-Droid with Gradle in a clean way
without manual interaction.
